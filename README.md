## Overview
State-space models are powerful frameworks for modeling sequential data and capturing dependencies over time. In this survey paper, we discuss three state-space models: LSTM, xLSTM, and Mamba. We conducted experiments with these models on the language modeling task and achieved the following results:

| Metric       | LSTM  | xLSTM | Mamba |
|--------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Perplexity (PPL) | 140  | 137  | 97  |

> Lower PPL indicates better performance.
